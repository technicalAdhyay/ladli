                Early Life
            </h4>
            <p class="abpage__pargraph">
                Born in Dakshin Puri Slum of South Delhi, Devendra Kumar Gupta embarked on his journey at the age of two when, his parents left him and his 3-days old infant sister with their paternal aunt. At a very young age, Devendra started to earn his living to look after his family consisting of his younger sister and elderly grandmother. At 9, when other kids of his age used to play with balloons, he used to sell, thinking about his family’s next uncertain meal. By 10, he was working as Chhotu (Child labour) at a chemist shop, as an aid, for a meagre amount of Rs.250/- per month, while continuing his schooling in a Government School.<br><br>Devendra’s first NGO “JOSH- EK UMANG” was a result of his concern for his fellow youth, who had their entire life to live, but were trapped in the vicious circle of drug addiction. Along with a group of likeminded people, he crusaded against drug addiction by seeking the help of Police, dissuading pharmacists from selling drugs without prescription. His diligence bore fruits, and he was able to rehabilitate more than 1500 youngsters through his creatively designed idea of involving drug and alcohol addicted unemployed males into “Kabaddi Sports” &amp; their volunteering at religious places.<br><br>He also exposed the malpractices of gas dealers, for instance, booking of refill domestic gas cylinders before 21 days, and illegal and forceful selling of gas stoves to consumers taking new connection, that benefitted millions of Indians across the country. His combat with dowry-demanding family, for his sister's marriage in the year 2010, switched his social journey to the welfare of uneducated girls, who couldn’t afford schooling, due to poverty and orthodox mentality of the society that doesn’t believe in female education. Thereafter, he started his grassroots research to evaluate the status-quo, of destitute unmarried girls, that has ultimately led him to establish the LADLI FOUNDATION TRUST.
